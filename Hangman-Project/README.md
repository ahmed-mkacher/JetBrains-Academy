Hello :wave::wave::smiley:

This is the first python project I've done following JetBrains Academy's learning path.
As you can see the project is Hangman.

I have added a few things, such as an ASCII art and a few accessebility comments.

I hope you like it, though I know it's not that big of a deal, it's just a first step!
Greater projects are coming!

Have fun playing the game! :smiley: and see you next time :wave:
