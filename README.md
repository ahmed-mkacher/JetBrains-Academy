# JetBrains-Academy

Hello there! :smiley:

Welcome to my JetBrains Academy GitHub repository! :grin:

I am a beginner in computer science and software developement.
At the moment of writing, I have just finished my first course on JetBrains Academy.
In the future, I will be posting all of the projects I code following the JetBrains Academy courses curriculum.

I hope you like my versions of these mini projects. :blush:
